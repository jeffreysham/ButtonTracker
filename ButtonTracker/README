Button Tracker Application

**************************************** SUMMARY ****************************************

The purpose of this application is to track the total number of buttons that a user has
pressed. The idea is to use an MVC model to fill in the starting files provided. Feel
free to deviate from the starting files, but make sure to remain within an MVC model.
Before reading through the features, make sure to look at the attached wireframes to
better understand the application.

**************************************** FEATURES ***************************************

- The header in the first table view should display the total number of buttons that
  have been pressed cumulated over all button groups.

- The first table view should display a list of the titles for each button group, as
  well as the number of selected buttons in each group (in the format "1/3").

- When a cell is pressed, sugue to a screen that displays all buttons in the groups
  stacked on top of each other.

- Each button can be selected or deselected, and its state must be saved when moving
  back and forth between screens. Note that the exact button that has been selected
  must persist. That is, if "Button 2" has been selected, "Button 2" must be selected
  the next time the group is loaded. The state does not need persist when the user has
  killed and reloaded the application.

- The label displaying the number of buttons selected in each group ("1/3") should
  update when the number of buttons selected in a group has changed.

- As shown in the wireframes, there must be three button groups: "Group 1" has 3 buttons,
  "Group 2" has 4 buttons, and "Group 3" has 5 buttons.
